        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>
            Your home, the place you've lived your entire life, is being invaded by an agressive neighboring country.
            They are after your country's resources and will stop at nothing to achieve control.

            <br>
            <br>

            You don't have much time and need to move quickly. It's only a matter of days before they reach your town.

            <br>
            <br>

            It's time to <em>Flee</em>.
